# CodeChronicle
Version, Archive, Document, Visualize, Compare your code

CodeChronicle was borne out of a need to be able to compare versions of reinforcement learning multifile projects
Your store your recorded files into a "frozen zips" folder and within this there are a series of zips containing all the relevant files you are making changes to.
You can comment on each version, compare code between versions and visualise videos of the end products
